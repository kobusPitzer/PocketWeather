# PocketWeather

This is a very simple implementation of the weather information at your current location. There is no current plans to maintain this code. This was an exercise in implementing a RESTful client and location information. I am open to any suggestions.

## Getting the app to run

Clone the repository and install needed dependencies if needed. Run through Android Studio and it should work.  Did not create a signed apk as this was a coding exercise. Needs current location as well as internet connection.

## Possible issues

The location service on some devices, such as Huawei, are known to bug. You might see an alien head and wonder why its not working and I found this to be an issue on Huawei P8 and above.

## Things to make it better

* Allow the user to add custom location
* More weather icons to show partly cloudy information and so on.
* Forecast the weather for chosen location.
* Save history of current location. (Using forecast and then looking back when needed)
* Use a better API key to do more accurate calls (This unfortunately costs money)

### Notes

I like a simple flat structure. The app looks exactly as I want it to. Only current needed information is given.
